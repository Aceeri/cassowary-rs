searchIndex["cassowary"] = {"doc":"This crate contains an implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm, based upon the work by\nG.J. Badros et al. in 2001. This algorithm is designed primarily for use constraining elements in user interfaces.\nConstraints are linear combinations of the problem variables. The notable features of Cassowary that make it\nideal for user interfaces are that it is incremental (i.e. you can add and remove constraints at runtime\nand it will perform the minimum work to update the result) and that the constraints can be violated if\nnecessary,\nwith the order in which they are violated specified by setting a &quot;strength&quot; for each constraint.\nThis allows the solution to gracefully degrade, which is useful for when a\nuser interface needs to compromise on its constraints in order to still be able to display something.","items":[[3,"Variable","cassowary","Identifies a variable for the constraint solver.\nEach new variable is unique in the view of the solver, but copying or cloning the variable produces\na copy of the same variable.",null,null],[3,"Term","","A variable and a coefficient to multiply that variable by.
